Shapes4learn
============

This project includes two main components:
# A framework to create and manipulate shapes.
# A small Swing application to render them and a text panel to write instructions.

The main goal of this project is to provide a skeleton for students to practice language processing. It may be used as an introduction to Compilers since it can covers most of the phases: lexical, syntactical and semantic analysis, code optimization and translation. The only and main difference is that, instead of generating machine code, it will interact with the shapes engine.

This framework is used for the Languages Processing course in Universidad Maim√≥nides in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
